    "text": "This project developed an optimization model for a real estate company in Laurelton, Queens, to maximize profit by balancing commission rates, staffing, and operational costs within a fixed monthly budget. The model found that lowering the commission rate from 5% to 4.33% and avoiding new hires maximizes profit by increasing market penetration while controlling costs. This strategy remained optimal across various sales forecasts, with projected profits between approximately $585,000 and $742,000. The recommendation is to maintain a 4.33% commission rate and current staffing levels to ensure profitability and sustainable growth over the next two years."
